# Scratch++
#### Scratch++ is a Scratch mod that adds new blocks which can compile to normal Scratch.

## How to use
Example:
In the editor, write a script with a new block (like the power operator).
```scratchblocks
when 🏳️ clicked
say ( 5 ^ 3 )
```
Then, click on `File` > `Compile to Scratch (.sb3)`. It should download an sb3 file that is fully compatible with normal Scratch.

## Installation
Go to the [releases tab](https://github.com/ZXMushroom63/scratch-gui/releases/latest), and download the zip file from the assets section.
Create a new folder on your computer, naming it whateverr you want.
Extract the zip file to this folder.
Open index.html in Chrome or your preferred browser!


## Building
This requires you to have Git and Node.js installed.


```bash
cd scratchplusplus #Folder dedicated to Scratch++

git clone --depth=1 https://github.com/ZXMushroom63/scratch-gui.git
cd scratch-gui
npm install

cd ..
git clone --depth=1 https://github.com/ZXMushroom63/scratch-vm.git
cd scratch-vm
npm install

cd ..
git clone --depth=1 https://github.com/ZXMushroom63/scratch-blocks.git
cd scratch-blocks
npm install
npm run translate
sudo npm run prepublish #Requires python 2 and Java installed!!!

cd ../scratch-gui
npm link ../scratch-blocks ../scratch-vm #Might also need sudo

# Now, to run it in localhost:
npm start

# Or, to make a build:
npm run build
# Outputs to the build folder
```

## Testing
### Documentation

You may want to review the documentation for [Jest](https://facebook.github.io/jest/docs/en/api.html) and [Enzyme](http://airbnb.io/enzyme/docs/api/) as you write your tests.

See [jest cli docs](https://facebook.github.io/jest/docs/en/cli.html#content) for more options.

### Running tests

*NOTE: If you're a Windows user, please run these scripts in Windows `cmd.exe`  instead of Git Bash/MINGW64.*

Before running any tests, make sure you have run `npm install` from this (scratch-gui) repository's top level.

#### Main testing command

To run linter, unit tests, build, and integration tests, all at once:
```bash
npm test
```

#### Running unit tests

To run unit tests in isolation:
```bash
npm run test:unit
```

To run unit tests in watch mode (watches for code changes and continuously runs tests):
```bash
npm run test:unit -- --watch
```

You can run a single file of integration tests (in this example, the `button` tests):

```bash
$(npm bin)/jest --runInBand test/unit/components/button.test.jsx
```

#### Running integration tests

Integration tests use a headless browser to manipulate the actual HTML and javascript that the repo
produces. You will not see this activity (though you can hear it when sounds are played!).

Note that integration tests require you to first create a build that can be loaded in a browser:

```bash
npm run build
```

Then, you can run all integration tests:

```bash
npm run test:integration
```

Or, you can run a single file of integration tests (in this example, the `backpack` tests):

```bash
$(npm bin)/jest --runInBand test/integration/backpack.test.js
```

If you want to watch the browser as it runs the test, rather than running headless, use:

```bash
USE_HEADLESS=no $(npm bin)/jest --runInBand test/integration/backpack.test.js
```

_Note: If you are seeing failed tests related to `chromedriver` being incompatible with your version of Chrome, you may need to update `chromedriver` with:_

```bash
npm install chromedriver@{version}
```

## Troubleshooting

### Ignoring optional dependencies

When running `npm install`, you can get warnings about optional dependencies:

```
npm WARN optional Skipping failed optional dependency /chokidar/fsevents:
npm WARN notsup Not compatible with your operating system or architecture: fsevents@1.2.7
```

You can suppress them by adding the `no-optional` switch:

```
npm install --no-optional
```

### Resolving dependencies

When installing for the first time, you can get warnings that need to be resolved:

```
npm WARN eslint-config-scratch@5.0.0 requires a peer of babel-eslint@^8.0.1 but none was installed.
npm WARN eslint-config-scratch@5.0.0 requires a peer of eslint@^4.0 but none was installed.
npm WARN scratch-paint@0.2.0-prerelease.20190318170811 requires a peer of react-intl-redux@^0.7 but none was installed.
npm WARN scratch-paint@0.2.0-prerelease.20190318170811 requires a peer of react-responsive@^4 but none was installed.
```

You can check which versions are available:

```
npm view react-intl-redux@0.* version
```

You will need to install the required version:

```
npm install  --no-optional --save-dev react-intl-redux@^0.7
```

The dependency itself might have more missing dependencies, which will show up like this:

```
user@machine:~/sources/scratch/scratch-gui (491-translatable-library-objects)$ npm install  --no-optional --save-dev react-intl-redux@^0.7
scratch-gui@0.1.0 /media/cuideigin/Linux/sources/scratch/scratch-gui
├── react-intl-redux@0.7.0
└── UNMET PEER DEPENDENCY react-responsive@5.0.0
```

You will need to install those as well:

```
npm install  --no-optional --save-dev react-responsive@^5.0.0
```

## Troubleshooting

If you run into npm install errors, try these steps:
1. run `npm cache clean --force`
2. Delete the node_modules directory
3. Delete package-lock.json
4. run `npm install` again

## Publishing to GitHub Pages
You can publish the GUI to github.io so that others on the Internet can view it.

## Understanding the project state machine

Since so much code throughout scratch-gui depends on the state of the project, which goes through many different phases of loading, displaying and saving, we created a "finite state machine" to make it clear which state it is in at any moment. This is contained in the file src/reducers/project-state.js .

It can be hard to understand the code in src/reducers/project-state.js . There are several types of data and functions used, which relate to each other:

### Loading states

These include state constant strings like:

* `NOT_LOADED` (the default state),
* `ERROR`,
* `FETCHING_WITH_ID`,
* `LOADING_VM_WITH_ID`,
* `REMIXING`,
* `SHOWING_WITH_ID`,
* `SHOWING_WITHOUT_ID`,
* etc.

### Transitions

These are names for the action which causes a state change. Some examples are:

* `START_FETCHING_NEW`,
* `DONE_FETCHING_WITH_ID`,
* `DONE_LOADING_VM_WITH_ID`,
* `SET_PROJECT_ID`,
* `START_AUTO_UPDATING`,

### How transitions relate to loading states

Like this diagram of the project state machine shows, various transition actions can move us from one loading state to another:

![Project state diagram](docs/project_state_diagram.svg)

_Note: for clarity, the diagram above excludes states and transitions relating to error handling._

#### Example

Here's an example of how states transition.

Suppose a user clicks on a project, and the page starts to load with URL https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/123456 .

Here's what will happen in the project state machine:

![Project state example](docs/project_state_example.png)

1. When the app first mounts, the project state is `NOT_LOADED`.
2. The `SET_PROJECT_ID` redux action is dispatched (from src/lib/project-fetcher-hoc.jsx), with `projectId` set to `123456`. This transitions the state from `NOT_LOADED` to `FETCHING_WITH_ID`.
3. The `FETCHING_WITH_ID` state. In src/lib/project-fetcher-hoc.jsx, the `projectId` value `123456` is used to request the data for that project from the server.
4. When the server responds with the data, src/lib/project-fetcher-hoc.jsx dispatches the `DONE_FETCHING_WITH_ID` action, with `projectData` set. This transitions the state from `FETCHING_WITH_ID` to `LOADING_VM_WITH_ID`.
5. The `LOADING_VM_WITH_ID` state. In src/lib/vm-manager-hoc.jsx, we load the `projectData` into Scratch's virtual machine ("the vm").
6. When loading is done, src/lib/vm-manager-hoc.jsx dispatches the `DONE_LOADING_VM_WITH_ID` action. This transitions the state from `LOADING_VM_WITH_ID` to `SHOWING_WITH_ID`
7. The `SHOWING_WITH_ID` state. Now the project appears normally and is playable and editable.
